player 1 moves a piece
  'drop' event sends the src and dest piece info to the server at /update
  the server looks at the info and determines that player one has made a move
  it tells player2 the src and dst information about player1's move. 
  player 2 updates the board. 
  when player 2 moves, the cycle repeats with player2's data as the moveData.
